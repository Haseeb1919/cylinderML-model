# Cylinder Surface Area Prediction Project

This project aims to predict the surface area of a cylinder based on its radius and height using machine learning models. Follow the steps below to set up and complete the project.

## Step 1: Generate and Split the Dataset

- Create a dataset with synthetic data points representing cylinders with various radii and heights.
- Split the dataset into a training set and a testing set with an 80/20 ratio.

## Step 2: Choose Machine Learning Models

- Select two machine learning models for this project: Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Random Forest.
- These models are suitable for regression tasks and will be used to predict the surface area of cylinders based on input features.

## Step 3: Train and Evaluate the Models

- Train the selected machine learning models using the training dataset.
- Adjust model parameters to optimize their fit to the data.
- Evaluate model performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared (R2) scores.

## Step 4: Create an Inference Script

- Develop an inference script that allows users to interact with the trained models.
- Users can input the radius and height of a cylinder, and the script will load the best-trained model to predict the cylinder's surface area based on the provided input.
